In the meantime, the hermit crab decides that the blue shell is rather small and uncomfortable. He decides to swap it for a green shell that he has found nearby. He moves into the green shell and brings along all of his belongings. The blue shell is now abandoned and empty. An octopus observes all this and ponders whether it is a good time to try to catch and eat the crab, but then he decides that it is still too early for dinner. A few nautical miles away, the mermaid finds her friends smoking seaweed. Naturally, she doesn't know what happened around here in her absence. \"\"\".replace(\"\\n\", \" \").replace(\"  \", \" \"), \"o1\":\"blue\", \"o2\":\"green\",\n",
